Task: Password Complexity Checker Application Date: 20-December-2024

*** WELCOME TO PASSWORD COMPLEXITY CHECKER APPLICATION ***

In the password complexity checker application evaluates a password's strength, categorizing it as "strong," "medium," or "weak." It validates criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. A password is classified as "strong" if it meets all criteria, "medium" if it lacks special characters, and "weak" if it falls short in other areas. This process clearly showcases how passwords are categorized based on their composition.
